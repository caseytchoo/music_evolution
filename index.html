       This project investigates how the sonic qualities, emotional tone, and cultural meaning of popular music have evolved from the 1950s to 2019 using a comprehensive Kaggle dataset of audio and lyrical features. By examining long-term trends in genre dominance, acousticness, loudness, instrumental characteristics, and emotion-related variables, we aim to understand how shifts in technology and cultural taste have shaped musical expression over the past seven decades. Our analysis reveals several consistent patterns: music has grown significantly louder across time, largely coinciding with the rise of digital production and mastering techniques; acousticness has steadily decreased, indicating a move toward more electronic sound design; and the distribution of genres has diversified, with the historical dominance of Rock and Pop giving way to increased representation of Hip Hop, Electronic, and other contemporary styles. In parallel, lyrical emotional signals exhibit notable fluctuations across decades, with happiness gradually declining while darker emotional cues show slight increases. By connecting sonic, cultural, and emotional dimensions, this study offers insight into the evolving landscape of modern music and highlights the extent to which technological innovation and cultural change continue to reshape the affective identity of popular sound.

       <p class="has-text-justified">
        As cultural tastes shift and production technology evolves, music genres change in parallel. Throughout this project, we examined how patterns of genre dominance moved across decades and what these transitions reveal about listener preferences, cultural trends, and the broader music industry. Our analysis highlights not only which genres rose or declined in popularity over time, but also how these dynamics coincide with meaningful changes in musical aesthetics. By comparing features such as acousticness, loudness, and lyrical emotional tone across genres, we observed that each genre carries distinct sonic and affective signatures that contribute to its cultural identity. Taken together, these findings suggest that the evolution of genre is not simply a reflection of changing fashion, but a response to deeper interactions between technology, consumer expectations, and the expressive goals of artists.

       This plot shows how the popularity of major genres shifts across decades. Rock and Pop are dominant in the earlier decades, but Hip hop and Electronic music rise significantly in later years. Reggae, Country, and Blues stay smaller but remain consistently present. The chart makes it clear that the music landscape becomes more diverse over time, with newer genres taking a larger share. These changes reflect cultural shifts, new technology, and evolving listener preferences.

            This chart compares how “acoustic” each genre sounds. Country, Blues, and Jazz show higher acousticness overall, meaning they rely more on natural instruments. Hip hop and Pop are less acoustic, which makes sense because they use more digital production. Rock sits in the middle with both electric and acoustic elements. The spread inside each box shows that some genres are more flexible in style, while others follow a more consistent sound identity.

           This visualization shows how often different genres use explicit or offensive language. Hip hop has the highest average obscene score, followed by Rock and Pop at lower levels. Jazz, Country, Reggae, and Blues tend to use little to no explicit language. These differences highlight how certain genres focus more on expressive, raw, or confrontational lyrics, while others keep a cleaner or more traditional lyrical style.

        As technology and social moods change, so does the loudness of the music we listen to. We examined how music volume has evolved over the decades, speculated on the underlying reasons, and explored its relationships with acousticness and instrumentalness.

        The emotional element is an essential part of music as music, and indeed any art form, is designed to evoke specific emotions in the listener/viewer. This section examines how the emotions contained in music have evolved over time. It also explores the relationship between loudness and emotion, as mentioned in the section above.

        This heatmap shows how happiness, sadness, violence, and romantic feelings, measured on a scale of 0 to 1, changed over time. Sadness and romanticism decreased, while violence increased. Happiness grew from 1960 to 1980, but has been declining since the 1990s. The changes in all emotional categories were not significant. Across all decades, happiness is consistently and overwhelmingly higher than the other emotions.

Happiness was highest in reggae and hip-hop, and lowest in jazz and rock.

    <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="has-text-justified">
      Across the seven decades examined in this study, the evolution of popular music reflects a clear interplay between technological change and cultural expression. The steady increase in loudness, accompanied by a marked reduction in acousticness, aligns with the widespread adoption of digital production, electronic instrumentation, and modern mastering practices. At the same time, emotional patterns within lyrics shifted in meaningful ways: although overall happiness has declined across genres, louder contemporary songs tend to be associated with more positive emotional signals than quieter ones, indicating that affect in popular music is mediated not only by lyrical content but also by sonic design. Collectively, these findings suggest that the sound and emotional character of popular music are shaped by both advances in production technology and broader transformations in listening culture, reinforcing that changes in musical aesthetics emerge from the interaction of artistic intent, audience expectations, and technological possibility.
